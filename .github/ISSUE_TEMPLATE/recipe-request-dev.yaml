        Does the app provide its own authentication (_i.e. NextCloud_), or does it require an authentication frontend (_i.e., Radarr_)?

        How should access to the app be managed?
      multiple: false
      options:
        - The app provides its own, trustworthy authentication, or access control is unnecessary. (*I'd be happy exposing it to the internet*)
        - The app needs something in front of it to secure access (_traefik-forward-auth, authelia, etc_)
