      description: |
        Does the app provide its own authentication (_i.e. NextCloud_), or does it require an authentication frontend (_i.e., Radarr_)?

        How should access to the app be managed? (_pick one if the answer is obvious_)
      options:
        - label: The app provides its own, trustworthy authentication, or access control is unnecessary. (*I'd be happy exposing it to the internet*)    
        - label: The app needs something in front of it to secure access (_traefik-forward-auth, authelia, etc_)
