      label: Authentication
      description: |
        Does the app provide its own authentication (_i.e. NextCloud_), or does it require an authentication frontend (_i.e., Radarr_)?

        How should access to the app be managed? (_pick one if the answer is obvious_)
      options:
        - label: The app provides its own, trustworthy authentication, or access control is unnecessary. (*I'd be happy exposing it to the internet*)    
        - label: The app needs something in front of it to secure access (_traefik-forward-auth, authelia, etc_)

      label: ‚öôÔ∏è Config Management
      description: How is the app configured? Some applications are configured [entirely using environment variables](https://12factor.net), some need static config files mounted into their container, and some are configured using an interactive setup process (_i.e. NextCloud_). 
      options:
        - label: The app is configured with environment variables
        - label: The app is configured with command-line arguments
        - label: The app is configured with a static config file on the filesystem
        - label: The app is configured interactively which then persists the config to the filesystem
