  - type: checkboxes
    id: authentication
    attributes:
      label: üîê Authentication
      description: |
        Does the app provide its own authentication (_i.e. NextCloud_), or does it require an authentication frontend (_i.e., Radarr_)?

        How should access to the app be managed? (_pick one if the answer is obvious_)
      options:
        - label: The app provides its own, trustworthy authentication, or access control is unnecessary. (*I'd be happy exposing it to the internet*)    
        - label: The app needs something in front of it to secure access (_traefik-forward-auth, authelia, etc_)

  - type: checkboxes
    id: config
    attributes:
      label: üíº Config Management
      description: How is the app configured? Some applications are configured [entirely using environment variables](https://12factor.net), some need static config files mounted into their container, and some are configured using an interactive setup process (_i.e. NextCloud_). 
      options:
        - label: The app is configured with environment variables
        - label: The app is configured with command-line arguments
        - label: The app is configured with a static config file on the filesystem

        - label: The app requires inbound web access HTTP/S access
        - label: The app requires inbound arbitrary TCP/UDP access
        - label: The app requires connectivity to other apps in its own stack (_i.e., a database_)

  - type: checkboxes
    id: persistence
    attributes:

    attributes:

      options:
        - label: The app does not require backup
        - label: The app can be backed up with a simple filesystem data copy
